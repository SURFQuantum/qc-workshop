    "Many quantum gates can be expressed as a composition of other gates, and therefore a quantum computer doesn't need to directly implement every possible gate. The minimum set of gates needed to generate all operations is called a \"universal gate set\". As the name suggests, a universal gate set is a collection of gates expressive enough that any possible operation on a quantum computer can be reduced to a sequence of those gates.\n",

    "As a side note, all single qubit operations can be written in a general unitary form with three parameters: $U3(\\theta, \\phi, \\lambda)$. Before running a circuit on a real quantum hardware, all single-qubit operations are compiled down to this form. For this reason, they are sometimes called the physical gates."
